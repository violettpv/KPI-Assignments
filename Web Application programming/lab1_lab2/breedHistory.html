            The Tonkinese came about because Siamese and Burmese fanatics wanted a cat with the same traits, but at a moderate level. The Tonkinese is active and playful but doesnâ€™t need extra stimulation to be happy. They like to chat and chirp at times but aren't as vocal as their Siamese mother. Even their stature is a perfect combination; the short and stocky Burmese contributes to their bulk, but the lanky Siamese gives them some height and agility.
            <br> <br>
            The Tonkinese first arrived in the U.S. in the 1930s. The same female cat who founded the Burmese breed in the U.S., Wong Mau, contributed to the Tonkinese breed; some Tonkinese lines can be traced back to Wong Mau today.
