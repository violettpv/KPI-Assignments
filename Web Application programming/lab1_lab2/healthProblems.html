                Though the Tonkinese is generally healthy, they are sometimes more prone to dental disease and feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD). 
            </p>
            <p>
                FLUTD causes cats discomfort or pain when urinating. Itâ€™s common in overweight cats but some breeds, like the Tonkinese, are affected by it more often. Signs that your Tonkinese may have FLUTD include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Straining to urinate;</li>
                <li>Frequent urination;</li>
                <li>Vocalization while urinating;</li>
                <li>Urinating outside the litterbox;</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Other illnesses that the Tonkinese may be at higher risk for include inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and excess protein deposits in their organs. IBD causes gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Excess protein deposits usually affect the liver in Tonkinese cats; due to a fault in Siamese lines, the bloodstream lets out too much amyloid protein in an organ. Signs and symptoms include lethargy, lack of appetite, vomiting, yellowing eyes and/or skin (jaundice), and swelling of the limbs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regular vet visits and a proper diet are essential to maintaining the health of any cat, so make sure your Tonkinese gets annual exams and stays up to date on shots.
