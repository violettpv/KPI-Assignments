        The Tonkinese is a breeze to care for. With a short coat that requires minimal upkeep, grooming is a rare necessity. Regular play is all they need as far as exercise goes, and occasional puzzle toys wouldn’t go amiss. 
        <br> 
        Unlike many cats, the Tonkinese is extremely social and loves human attention. If you’re looking for a kitty who can be happy at home alone while you work long hours, the Tonkinese isn’t right for you. They want to be with you as much as possible and make a great companion.
        <br>
        Because the Tonkinese is prone to gingivitis, you should start brushing their teeth when they're a kitten so they get used to it over time. You can also look into water additives to help keep their pearly whites clean and healthy. 
        <br>
        Moderate as always, the Tonkinese is a cat with a balanced personality. They're intelligent and active, but they don't bounce off the walls or engage in much mischief. They speak when spoken to, but don't vocalize their every move. They love to play, but is always down to hop in your lap for a snuggle sesh.
        <br>
        The only trait of the Tonkinese that isn’t moderate is their level of affection. The Tonkinese loves people and is well-known as an extremely loving lap cat. Families with young children who need a tolerant, playful cat to complete their home would get along perfectly with the Tonkinese.
        <br>
        If you don’t have other pets in the home, consider a second kitty—the Tonkinese loves to have a playmate and companion when their human is away. If you do have other pets in the home, you can look forward to the Tonkinese making animal buddies right away.
